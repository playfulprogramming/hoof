This repository contains backend services for the [Playful Programming](https://playfulprogramming.com/) website and (future) content management system.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22
- Docker
- pnpm 10.6.1

## Quick Start

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Set up secrets & environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Start background services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Run the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Once it's running, you should see the API documentation hosted at `http://localhost:3000/docs/`. This can also be used to test the endpoints!

## Roadmap

- Manage tasks for post image & metadata generation (initial deployment)
- Index & sync post content from the [main repository](https://github.com/playfulprogramming/playfulprogramming/)
- Provide APIs to query that content on-demand (so that playfulprogramming can switch to SSR)
- Enable user accounts & login
- Provide APIs to directly create and edit site content
